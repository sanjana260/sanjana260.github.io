          <b>Software Engineering GenAI Project</b>
          <p>During my final year at the IITM BS program, I collaborated with a team of 7 to create a dummy version of the University portal and integrated

            improving the accessibility of course content. Also created a chatbot to answer student queries and enabled personalized practice questions generation 
            based on student requirements, and a fully functioning API. </p>

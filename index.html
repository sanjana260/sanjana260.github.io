          <b>Software Engineering GenAI Project</b>
          <p>During my final year at the IITM BS program, I collaborated with a team of 7 to create a dummy version of the University portal and integrated 
            various GenAI features into the portal interface. Utilized Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate lecture summaries from transcripts, 
            improving the accessibility of course content. Also created a chatbot to answer student queries and enabled personalized practice questions generation 
            based on student requirements, and a fully functioning API. </p>
